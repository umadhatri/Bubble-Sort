# Bubble-Sort
It's a simple bubble sort in C
## Why I built it?  
It's a simple challenge in GHW. So, I did it  
## Why bubble sort?  
I don't know. I guess I just like the name  
## What it does?  
Its a pretty simple algorithm. If it finds that a bigger number is to the right of a smaller number, it swaps them. It keeps doing this until all the numbers are in order.
